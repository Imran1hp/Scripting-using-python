## 🧠 Features

- 📂 Organizes various game files (in `.go` and `.py` formats)
- 🧾 Extracts and parses game-related metadata
- 🧰 Provides a Python interface to work with structured game files
- ⚡ Modular and extendable for new game formats or logic

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Scripting-using-python-main.git
   cd Scripting-using-python-main
Run the main script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
Modify or extend:

Add more .go files in the data/ directory

Update the logic in get_game_data.py to handle new patterns

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.8+

No external libraries needed (pure Python!)

🧪 Examples
rock_paper_scissors_game ➡️ Implements basic game logic in Go

simon_says_game ➡️ Fun memory game logic

hello_world_game ➡️ Minimal Go game structure
